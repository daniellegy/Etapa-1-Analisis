Hello, I'm Theo.
  I live in the neighborhood of Exarcheia and I deal exclusively with the short-term rental of my privately owned apartments, so I have the opportunity to have discreet but direct contact with my guests and I will be very happy to help your smooth stay in Athens.
  I live very close to all my apartments and, as I am fully committed to the convenience and care of my guests' accommodation, I am always happy to meet new people and share local tips and ""inside information"" of the city.

  During the summer, I am also happy to have my guests at home for coffee or a drink - my house has a wonderful terrace with stunning views of Lycabettus, the Parthenon and the cityscape of Athens.  You'll love it!  In any other case, you will probably meet  coffee of the Exarcheion say hello and have a raki with me!
