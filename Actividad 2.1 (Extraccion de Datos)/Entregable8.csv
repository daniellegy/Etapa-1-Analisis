First of all thank you for checking on my listing, hope you choose it for your holidays. I will do the best from my side to have a great stay. Being an Airbnb host has become my latest passion. I have met so many interesting people and cultures the last years as a host. I love watching my new born daughter grow up. My favorite habits are cycling through the city, hiking and strolling downtown. I have done my best to provide you a clean and safe environment for your stay. If you have any questions donât hesitate to ask I will answer asap.
The motos i try to follow in my life are 
âBe the change that you wish to see in the world.â and 
âNo one has ever become poor by giving.â
