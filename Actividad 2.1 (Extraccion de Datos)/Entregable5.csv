But here I am, 20 something years later, with our fabulous biz ""Greek Vacation Rentals"",  opening up our amazing Acropolis view family & group friendly Athens apartments & our MagicFactoryLofts, spacious art filled homes in Chicago, while planning RealGreece travel itineraries and leading small group food & wine focused tours around my adopted homeland and loving the life that I am lucky enough to be living. Of course I did pick up an equally crazy, workaholic Greek husband along the way, as well as a stray Greek animal or two!

Update: January 2023 .... This year Basil and I celebrate 20 years opening our Greek vacation rentals to guests from around the world. All these years we've been hopping between Basil's home city, Athens and Carole's home city of Chicago.  Time and time again guests in Greece asked us if they can stay in our Chicago home while we're in Athens.... so now you can stay in Chicago in our art filled Magic Factory Lofts. We've got 3 and 4 bedroom homes in the heart of the city with Big Shoulders -  in our hybrid warehouse (which in a previous life housed a bar and a dance hall, followed by a costume and magic card factory and then a photography studio where probably every Butterball turkey advertisement in the 1980s was shot .... the photos, not the turkeys!)

So come stay with us ... and then stay with us again. Whether you'd like to enjoy an ouzo in Athens overlooking the Acropolis the Acropolis View Alpha or 7 bedroom  Acropolis SkyVilla, or a beer and a hot dog in Chicago while staying at  our Magic Factory Lofts  we know that you won't be disappointed. 

All of our places are perfect for 3 generation families, multiple couples (especially in Athens pre or post cruise), or groups of friends on a city break or vacation.
