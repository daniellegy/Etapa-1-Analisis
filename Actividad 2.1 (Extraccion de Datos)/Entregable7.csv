I am Alexandros, an ex-financier who turned into an entrepreneur.

I grew up in Athens, Greece, an awesome and vibrant city, where I studied Civil Engineering at NTUA. I was always keen on music, a passion which I flipped into DJing, yeap!!! Following my graduation I wanted to see the world and study abroad, so I attended Columbia University in NYC for my second Masters degree. The 2008 crash sent me directly to Germany where I started my career in banking.

After some years in corporate environments I decided to follow my real love, which is creating things from scratch, so I quit my job and alongside with my brother, George, we began a hospitality start-up.

We provide unique furnished apartments by offering personalized services!

It is so awesome to be an explorer and we believe that if you do not travel is like reading only the cover of the book. Hence,  t-r-a-v-e-l  :)

We hope to enjoy your staying with us!!!!

I am married to Kiriaki and we have 2 sons.

I own and manage many apartments in the very inner center circle of Athens (some of them beside the Metro, in 30-50m) and a few others in the larger Athens. 
All of them are either brand new or recently fully renovated. 
Depending on the apartment, they dispose free private Parking, extraordinary views of the city, Smart TVs, Satellite TV connection (1200 free channels), etc. They all beautifully decorated and dispose fully equipped (for long stays) kitchens, 42-50"" LED TVs, Home Cinema, DVD collection, WiFi internet, A/C in all rooms, outdoor space (terrace, balcony, patio).
 
What I love mostly in my work is to meet different people & cultures from all over the world and to share our experience of life. 
What a wonderful feeling is when my guests thank me after having spent some unforgettable time in one of my apartments in this great city - Athens.
I wouldn't exchange this for the world.

I'll be very happy to host you in one of my apartments and provide you with all necessary information and tips on what you ""must see"", where and how to go, where to eat (and where not...!!) and so make your life easy and save a lot of your vacation time.

I can organize your transports inside/out of Athens (with VIP vehicles), starting from your pick-up from/to the airport, then a tour around the sites of Athens or a short daily escape to the larger Attica or your trip to Delphi, Mycenae, Epidaurus, Ancient Olympia, etc. 

Don't hesitate to contact me for further information (...no charge...!!).
